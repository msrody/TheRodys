# IC's Are For Foreigners Too

Healthy IC's are always sending believers off to other places. Helping their people find new, healthy churches in the place they are moving to. May in the IC locals with a life long participation, but many are on short term assignments or come with no plan to stay until God changes their direction. IC's need to be churches that are socially agile, able to absorb new people and release those who are going away, while renewing quickly with those who come back. Many languages may be represented, social groups may form by ethnicity, nationality or language affinity, but in the great diversity, we are the church, full of the Holy Spirit and called to unity in the body of Christ to fulfill His purpose and display His glory to the whole world.
