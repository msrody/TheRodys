## Time with extended Family.

Having been a way so long we are vary aware how blessed we are this year to have time with extended family.  We've missed that and though we see some of our family when they visit Jakarta, many of our family members have grown up a lot since we've been gone.  It's so good to spend time with Mike's sister and her family, with Auntie Charlotte and several other relatives we've seen along the way.

Generally we celebrate all the holidays and because we are in a major city, we have access to special holiday food with our family who are there, but there's nothing like being home with cold weather and family for Thanksgiving.

## Cold weather

Yes, cold weather is something we miss.  For a few years in Jakarta, James, Julius and I had a tradtion of swimming in the pool on Thanksgiving.  It's just not the same. We have had some cold weather and some beautiful scenery to go along with it.  We've also had a bit of trecrous driving in the mountain passes in recent weeks.  None the less, we have missed our cold weather.  Of course, we've had to aquire some cold weather cloths as well. Our shortsleaves and quick dry t-shirts don't do so well in the cool Pacific Northwest, but our friend Eddie Bauer comes to the rescue time and again.
