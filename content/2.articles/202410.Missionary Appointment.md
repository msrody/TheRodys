Approval For Missionary Appointment!

#description
After 11 years serving as Missionary Associates, we took the treck to Springfield for interviews and orientation in order to be approved for full appointment with Assembly of God World Missions. It's been quite a journey. 
::

One of the primary reasons for our return to the us was to fullfill our commitment to pursue full appointment with AGWM.  We've served for the past 11 years at Missionary Associates and then Career Missionary Associates. For us it's been more of an administrative designation, that had little impact on our ministry.  However, AGWM is a big part of our ministry and moving forward it just seemed better for us to pursue full appointment.  So after 11 years of hiding out, laying low, flying under the radar, we're now taking on the responcibility and opportunity of being fully appointed missionaries with AGWM.

To accomplish this, we've filled out forms, written essays, filled out more forms, had background checks and fianancial clearance.  We submitted applications with references and submitted more references. The final step as to go to Springfield. That was an adventure in itself that we may write about in another article, but with some schedule shifting on their part, it worked out for us to go this year.

Our whole time there was full of meetings, administrative orientation and interviews. We recieved our preliminary budget. This represents the money we will need to raise in order to get approval to retun to Indonesia. The funding will include all of our expenses for living, work and projects and has subsequently frown to almost $9000 a month. We think it may be as much at $10,000 a month by the time it is finalized. That means we need 100 churches, families or individuals to partner with us for $100 a month. Now that's a big ask, but God will provide.

Having been working in our area for along time and having had previous leadership rolls beyond my our immediate ministry, it was a rather relaxed time. Most of the other candidates were quite nervous. We were pretty relaxed and able to help a few other young missionaries settle their nerves before the big interview. Our big interview consited of an hour telling stories of God's faithfulness in leading us through life and ministry and the impact we've seen him have on those around us.  It was great and we probably could have gone another hour easily.

In the end, our interview board forwarded their recomendation to approve us to the larger World Missions Committe who voted for thier approve the following day. Now starts the new journey and God will continue to lead the way.
