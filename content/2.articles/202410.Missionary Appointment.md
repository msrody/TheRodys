Approval For Missionary Appointment!

#description
After 11 years serving as Missionary Associates, we took the trek to Springfield for interviews and orientation in order to be approved for full appointment with Assembly of God World Missions. It's been quite a journey. 
::

One of the primary reasons for our return to the US was to fulfill our commitment to pursue full appointment with AGWM.  We've served for the past 11 years at Missionary Associates and then Career Missionary Associates. For us it's been more of an administrative designation that had little impact on our ministry.  However, AGWM is a big part of our ministry and moving forward it just seemed better for us to pursue full appointment.  So after 11 years of hiding out, laying low, flying under the radar, we're now taking on the responsibility and opportunity of being fully appointed missionaries with AGWM.

To accomplish this, we've filled out forms, written essays, filled out more forms, had background checks and financial clearance.  We submitted applications with references and submitted more references. The final step was to go to Springfield. That was an adventure in itself that we may write about in another article, but with some schedule shifting on their part, it worked out for us to go this year.

Our whole time there was full of meetings, administrative orientation and interviews. 

## Budget

We received our preliminary budget. This represents the money we will need to raise in order to get approval to retun to Indonesia. The funding will include all of our expenses for living, work and projects and has subsequently frown to almost $9000 a month. We think it may be as much as $10,000 a month by the time it is finalized. That means we need 100 churches, families or individuals to partner with us for $100 a month. Now that's a big ask, but God will provide.

## Interviews

We had 3 interviews scheduled amongst the other events. Having worked in our area for a long time and having had previous leadership roles on interview committees for credentials, these did not seem all that stressful. I think Chelly and I enjoyed them all. Most of the other candidates were quite nervous. We were pretty relaxed and able to help a few other young missionaries settle their nerves before the "big" interview. Our big interview consisted of an hour telling stories of God's faithfulness in leading us through life and ministry and the impact we've seen him have on those around us. The committee had good questions and we felt we had good stories to answer with. In the end we probably could have gone another hour easily, but I'm sure they were ready to move on.

After a short wait in the lobby, we were invited back in to find out that our interview board would forwarded their recommendation on to the larger World Missions Committee for approval in session the following day. The following day, the approvals were made and our status had changed. Now starts the new journey and God will continue to lead the way and provide for all we need.
