Our Itineration Has Begun!

#description
Our process of itineration has begun. We are meeting with pastors, visiting and preaching at churches and making connections future partners wherever we may find them. In the past few weeks we had the opportunity to minister in [2 churches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ANTmu6c79Jaa8NRF7) in very different parts of our state.  Forks Washington was our first service in the rainiest town in North America. Sunnyside, WA, one of the driest towns in the State of Washington, was our second stop.

We had great services in both churches and have great hope they will partner with us in an ongoing relationship.

## Itineration

As we've told so many people the main reason we're in the US is to ***itinerate***. Whenever we talk with people about our plans, we have come to realize that most of our friends don't really know what this means. To help you undersand what we'll be doing over the next year, I'll take a little space here for a simple explaination of ***itineration***.

In the US Assemblies of God, and in many other church and missions organizations around the world, missionaries start their mission endeavor by presenting their ministry in many local churches. They travel from church to church, speaking in services, sharing with small groups, meeting with Pastor's and misions leadership teams. Missionaries share both God's vision and plan for the lost as well the vision and plans for the ministry God has given them, what they hope to pursue in the place and minstry God has laid on their hearts. 

### Inform, Inspire and Minister

Of primary importance in itineration and the reason to go to so many different churches, is to inform, inspire and to minister to churches. This is the great opportunity Missionaries have to invest in the churches of their sending communities. Sometimes that is inspiring the next generation of those who will seek God's call and join Him in full time ministry. It may be that the missionary illustrates the need in such a way that church members hear from the Holy Spirit and join in partnership in prayer or giving.



Not every missionary is all that inspirational as an individual but we trust the Holy Spirit to do the work every time we have the opportunity to speak. Our inspiration however is not always emotional. At times we share ministry ideas that inspire the local church to develop new ministry of their own, or possibly we help our local churches see thier community in a new way that helps the church expand it's vision for ministry in thier own community in addition to ministry as around the world.

As I well know, being a pastor can be challenging and at times discouraging. Missionaries have the opportunity to come in from the outside when the Pastor, church staff or ministry leadership needs to be heard, lifted up and or encouraged. All of the above could take place in any given stop in the itineraion. That's one of the things that makes itineration an exciting ministry opportunity. We look forward to making this investement in our churches. It's really our desire to bless those who will join us in partnership.

### Build Partnerships

The second half of the itineration role is to build partnerships.  Partnerships are relationships with people and with churches that God uses to enable missionaries to go and do do what God has prepared for them to accomplish.

#### Fund Raising

Obviously fund raising is important. God is the provider. He has not called people to solitary ministry. God has called the church to minster and support ministry globaly. That means God provides for his people who join in partnership in ministry and missions. For this reason, missionaries engage the church to join in the mission.

Some churches are ready to jump on board with missionaries as soon as they are ready to go.  That's fantastic because asking for money is a hard and having people think you're talking to them just to ask for money is even harder. Most pastors and churches want to hear from those they will send out. Many individuals are personally inspired to participate in regular giving and this usually comes out of a time hearing the missionary share about God's work and the Holy Spirit speaking to their hearts to give and to pray. In the end it is the Holy Spirit that does the work.

We have a great appreciation for the churches that have already made a commitment to partner wth us, even though in most cases, we have never visited them. We also really appreciate those who have come on board with us as financial partners to enable us to do the mission God has for us to do. This has been a tremendous help, since in our 11 years of ministry with AGWM we have never itinerated before. If we had gone about it in the normal way, we would be starting our 3rd itineration cycle.  We would alread have had a solid giving base here in the US. Again, God is our provider. He is the one who has provided for 11 year and we believe he will provide for all that we need ahead.


#### Prayer

Anyone in ministry needs prayer and one of the great privileges of missions is the open opportunity we have to ask for prayer and expectation that people will pray for us and our ministry. At every chuch we ask for prayer for our ministry, our family and for Indonesia as a whole.

Wherever we go we give out prayer cards.  These are reminders for peole to pray for us. We make ours a bit bigger than normal so people can put them out where they will see them and remember to pray more often.

I remember so many stories of people waking in the night to pray for missionaries and I've had my own experience of having the urge to pray for people, who, as I found out later, were in the midts of significant need at that time.  God is faithful and He has called us to be faithful in prayer for those in ministry and especially those we partner with and send out in ministry.

#### Participation

We are very serious in our desire to see people commit themselves to ministry and to partner with us in person.  Yes, we hope to find people called by God who will venture out to missions in Indonesia.  We also hope to find people who know God is calling but have not had a cross-cultural ministry experience and would like to do a ministry internship in IES or who would like to join the campus ministy team in Jogjakarta or would like to take on a ministry role at one of our other international churches around Indonesia or the rest of Asia Pascific.  We firmly believe that many are called but don't understand the opportunity God has laid out in front of them.  We want to take the opportunity to share the great possibilities that are open today.
