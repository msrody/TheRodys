Spring Is In The Air.

#description
This view from the Sprague, WA rest stop along I-90 reminds me that the future is bright even if it's cloudy up close.

## Mile Post 3350

In the month of March we drove 3350 miles to services, pastors meetings and missions celebration events. Though 2024 ended slowly and 2025 started slow, March came in like a lion! Now that's usually a reference the weather around here, but God blessed us with lots of safe miles, not hard weather. Most of these miles Mike drove solo back and forth to Eastern Washington. 3350, that's a lot of miles!

## Eastern Washington is beautiful in the Spring
Though We tried to schedule our Eastern Washington tour to avoid snow in the mountian passes, Mike did have the privilege of driving throught the first snow storm of the year back in November and a few light fluries in the passes this March. In November, he was returning home from the Okanogan Area Meeting. We're pleased to be beyond winter.

We've always thought Eastern Washington is beautiful, especially in the Spring. Mike had the privilege of watching Spring come on through the month of March with travel to [Riverside](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ekW1Xa5ryChZzM197){:target="_blank"} , [Hartline](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBYCjh3DAtCwkS9b7){:target="_blank"} , [Moses Lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kNjjnPC3C5BeSs33A){:target="_blank"} , [Spokane](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rVhw68Xf9HmW7aPz6){:target="_blank"}  and [Chewelah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ss6R95XwFNZk5jQn8){:target="_blank"} . We've included the map links in case you've not heard of some of these places. Most of these are not big places, some are out of the way if you're not going there, but in each of these communities God's church is full of faithful people praying for and supporting missions world wide. They may be small, remote or hard to pronounce but they have opportunity to impact lives the world over as they partner with us and many others in missions.

Our travel has taken us to Sunday services and area pastors meetings and mid-week missions panel discusions. Traveling alone, Mike didn't take as many pictures, but we were blessed everywhere we went. Like Crosspoint Assembly of God, with Pastor Randy Base, in Union Gap, where one of Mike's great uncles or distant cousins may have pastored, long, long ago, before any of the current church members were probably alive.

Special thanks to Hartline Assembly and Pastor Michael Mele who put Mike up on a Sunday night so he could attend the area pastors meeting in Moses Lake the following morning. What a pleasure to join the church for a worship and prayer service that Sunday evening and wake up to the beautiful sunrise seen at the top of the page. We're looking forward to being in Hartline again this Summer.Wonderful people and wonderful worship and prayer night.

After a month like March, our provervial hat is off to Cedar Park Assembly in Bothel for their missionary car ministry. We and many other missionaries are blessed to access their vehicles while we're home and traveling about. When our car died and early death at the top of Blewett Pass in October, they quickly found a replacement that has carried us a long way. In a few months we'll get the old car back which is running well with it's manufacturer replaced engine.
