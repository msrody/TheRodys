Spring Is In The Air.

This view from the Sprague, WA rest area, along I-90 reminds us the future is bright even if it's cloudy up close.

## Mile Post 3350

In the month of March we drove 3350 miles to services, pastors meetings and missions celebration events. Though 2024 ended slowly and 2025 started slow, March came in like a lion! Now that's usually a reference the weather around here, but God blessed us with lots of safe miles, not hard weather. Most of these miles Mike drove solo back and forth to Eastern Washington. 3350, that's a lot of miles!

## Eastern Washington is beautiful in the Spring
Though We tried to schedule our Eastern Washington tour to avoid snow in the mountian passes, Mike did have the privilege of driving throught the first snow storm of the year back in November and a few light fluries in the passes this March. In November, he was returning home from the Okanogan Area Meeting. We're pleased to be beyond winter.

We've always thought Eastern Washington is beautiful, especially in the Spring. Mike had the privilege of watching Spring come on through the month of March with travel to [Riverside](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ekW1Xa5ryChZzM197){:target="_blank"} , [Hartline](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBYCjh3DAtCwkS9b7){:target="_blank"} , [Moses Lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kNjjnPC3C5BeSs33A){:target="_blank"} , [Spokane](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rVhw68Xf9HmW7aPz6){:target="_blank"} and [Chewelah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ss6R95XwFNZk5jQn8){:target="_blank"} . We've included the map links in case you've not heard of some of these places. Most of these are not big places, some are out of the way if you're not going there, but in each of these communities God's church is full of faithful people praying for and supporting missions world wide. They may be small, remote or hard to pronounce but they have opportunity to impact lives the world over as they partner with us and many others in missions.

Our travel has taken us to Sunday services and area pastors meetings and mid-week missions panel discusions. Traveling alone, Mike didn't take as many pictures, but we were blessed everywhere we went. Like Crosspoint Assembly of God, with Pastor Randy Base, in Union Gap, where one of Mike's great uncles or distant cousins may have pastored, long, long ago, possibly before any of the current church members were alive.

Special thanks to Hartline Assembly and Pastor Michael Mele who put Mike up on a Sunday night so he could attend the area pastors meeting in Moses Lake the following morning. What a pleasure to join the church for a worship and prayer service that Sunday evening and wake up to the beautiful sunrise seen at the top of the page. We're looking forward to being in Hartline again this Summer.Wonderful people and wonderful worship and prayer night.

After a month like March, our provervial hat is off to Cedar Park Assembly in Bothel for their missionary car ministry. We and many other missionaries are blessed to access their vehicles while we're home and traveling about. When our car died and early death at the top of Blewett Pass in October, they quickly found a replacement that has carried us a long way. In a few months we'll get the old car back which is running well with it's manufacturer replaced engine.

The past two weeks we've been in Skagit county. Our first stop was at Citipoint in Mt. Vernon. It was great to see a thriving church with young and not so young alike particpating in a vibrant church life. It was also great to see Pastor Brent and Jessie Kimble and their Missions Director Dani Needham. Mike was on Brent's board when Brent was at Sero Wooley, where he did a great job bringing the church back to life after some big struggles and a period as a home missions church. They are doing well again in Mt. Vernon where it's so good to see this church growing again with a clear vision for the future.

Our last stop this past weekend was in Anacortes with Pastor Brent Osburn. Here is another church starting to grow after some struggles. The first time Mike met Brent, he was about 5 years old in Sumner Assembly where Mike interned and was Children's pastor for a little bit prior to going to Jakarta. It's good to see the church moving forward and exciting to see Brent leading well. We met friends from Neighborhood church, Ron & June West who have been retired in Anacortes for over 30 years. We had lunch with Leland & Dora Rilea. We first met them in Bangkok not long after we were married. We ministerd with MRAP there and connected with them a few other times over the years.

God is good! He has provided and protected through all this travel. We have seen the good outcomes of persistence in ministry with God restoring churches and renewing lives. We've prayed with many who felt God was speaking to them while they were seeking His direction. It's great to see the church alive. It is one of the blessings on this itineration tour we're on and we're thanking God all the way.
