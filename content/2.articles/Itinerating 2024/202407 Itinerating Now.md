## Back in the US

We've enjoyed being back in the US, though we really miss Jakarta and especially we miss our church, IES Jakarta.

We've seen a lot of unique things as we've traveled about these past few weeks.

Family of course is a big part of being back in the US. It's always good to be with our young men, and Mom. We are blessed to have spent some time with Teri, Kirk and Hayden as well as Auntie Charlotte, with whome we keep forgetting to take pictures.

## Itineration

The main reason we're in the US is to ***Itinerate***. As we talk with many people about our plans we have come to realize that a of our friends don't really know what this means. So I'll take a little space here for a simple explaination of itineration.

In the US Assemblies of God, and in many other church and missions organizations around the world, missionaries start their mission endeavor by presenting their ministry in many local churches. They travel from church to church speaking in services, sharing with small groups, meeting with Pastor's and misions leadership teams. Missionarys share both God's vision and plan for the lost as well their vision and plans for the ministry they hope to pursue. 

### Inform, Inspire and Minister

Of primary importance in itineration and the reason to go to so many different churches, is to inform, inspire and to minister to churches. This is the great opportunity Missionaries have to invest in churches in their sending communities. Sometimes that is inspiring the next generation of those who will seek God's call and join Him in full time ministry. It may be that the missionary illustrates the need in such a way that church members hear from the Holy Spirit and join in partnership in prayer or giving.  

Not every missionary is all that inspirational, but we trust the Holy Spirit to do the work every time we have the opportunity to speak. Our inspiration however is not always emotional.  At times we share ministry ideas that inspire the local church to develop new ministry of their own. Or maybe to help our local churches see thier community in different way that helps them to expand their vision for ministry.

At times, it's the Pastor, church staff or ministry leadership that needs to be heard, lifted up and encouraged.  Often it's all fo the above. That's why we see this information, inspiration and minstry function as an important investement in our churches. 


#### Fund Raising

Obviously fund raising is important. God is the provider but God has not called people to solitary ministry. God has called the church to minster and that means that God provides for his people who join in partnership in ministry and missions. For this reason, missionaries engage the church to join in the mission.  Some churches are ready to jump on board with missionaries as soon as they are ready to go, but most churches want to hear from those they will send.  Many individuals are also inspired to participate in regular giving and this usually comes out of a time hearing the missionary share about God's work and the Holy Spirit speaking to their hearts to give.

We really appreciate the churches that have already made a commitment to partner wth us, even though in most cases we have never visited them.  We also really appreciate those who have come on board with us as financial partners to enable us to do the mission God has for us to do.



#### Prayer

Anyone in ministry needs prayer and one of the great privileges of missions is the open opportunity we have to ask for prayer and expectation that people will pray for us.  At every chuch we ask for prayer for our ministry, our family and for Indonesia as a whole.

Wherever we go we give out prayer cards.  These are reminders for peole to pray for us.
