## Back in the US

We've enjoyed being back in the US. Though we really miss Jakarta and especially our church, [IES Jakarta](https://iesjakarta.org), we've enjoyed our time reconnecting with people and American culture. We've traveled alot of miles over the past few weeks and in the process seen lot of interesting things along the way. Unfortunately we couldn't take pictures of all of them but here are a few of the unique vehicles we've seen and some rather interesting animals as well.

The things we've seen are interesting, but far better are all the people we've been able to reconnect with. We've had gatherings and surprise encounters alike. Much of the time we had so much fun we forgot to take pictures. This is especially true for family. Family of course is a big part of being back in the US. It's always good to be with our young men, Julius and James and of course to see Mom. We are blessed to have spent time with Teri, Kirk and Hayden as well as Auntie Charlotte, with whom we keep forgetting to take pictures.

It's been great to be here, but now it's time to get to work.

## Itineration

The main reason we're in the US is to ***Itinerate***. As we talk with many people about our plans we have come to realize that many of our friends don't really know what this means. So I'll take a little space here for a simple explaination of ***itineration***.

In the US Assemblies of God, and in many other church and missions organizations around the world, missionaries start their mission endeavor by presenting their ministry in many local churches. They travel from church to church, speaking in services, sharing with small groups, meeting with Pastor's and misions leadership teams. Missionarys share both God's vision and plan for the lost as well their vision and plans for the ministry they hope to pursue in the place and minstry God has laid on their hearts. 

### Inform, Inspire and Minister

Of primary importance in itineration and the reason to go to so many different churches, is to inform, inspire and to minister to churches. This is the great opportunity Missionaries have to invest in churches in their sending communities. Sometimes that is inspiring the next generation of those who will seek God's call and join Him in full time ministry. It may be that the missionary illustrates the need in such a way that church members hear from the Holy Spirit and join in partnership in prayer or giving.  

Not every missionary is all that inspirational, but we trust the Holy Spirit to do the work every time we have the opportunity to speak. Our inspiration however is not always emotional. At times we share ministry ideas that inspire the local church to develop new ministry of their own, or possibly we help our local churches see thier community in a new way that helps the church expand it's vision for ministry in thier own community as well as around the world.

At times, it's the Pastor, church staff or ministry leadership that needs to be heard, lifted up and encouraged.  Often it's all fo the above. That's one of the things that makes itineration an exciting ministry opportunity.  We look forward to making this investement in our churches. 

#### Fund Raising

Obviously fund raising is important. God is the provider. He has not called people to solitary ministry. God has called the church to minster and support ministry globaly. That means God provides for his people who join in partnership in ministry and missions. For this reason, missionaries engage the church to join in the mission. Some churches are ready to jump on board with missionaries as soon as they are ready to go, but most churches want to hear from those they will send out. Many individuals are personally inspired to participate in regular giving and this usually comes out of a time hearing the missionary share about God's work and the Holy Spirit speaking to their hearts to give and to pray.

We have a great appreciation for the churches that have already made a commitment to partner wth us, even though in most cases, we have never visited them. We also really appreciate those who have come on board with us as financial partners to enable us to do the mission God has for us to do. This has been a tremendous help, since in our 11 years of ministry with AGWM we have never itinerated before. For most missionaries we would be itinerating for the 3rd time.  We would have had a solid giving base here in the US. It's okay though, because God is our provider.


#### Prayer

Anyone in ministry needs prayer and one of the great privileges of missions is the open opportunity we have to ask for prayer and expectation that people will pray for us and our ministry. At every chuch we ask for prayer for our ministry, our family and for Indonesia as a whole.

Wherever we go we give out prayer cards.  These are reminders for peole to pray for us.
