IES Finds Partners For Effective Compassion Ministry.

#description
Where IC's are surrounded by great need they becomes a great tool to impact comunities through compassion ministries.
::

IC members tend to be people of great compassion, awareness of their privilege, and desire to care for those in need. People working in development or compassion-related fields are often part of the IC congregation and become an asset for the church in connecting with opportunities to care for those in need. Itâ€™s also common that the entrepreneurial spirit combines with a passion for ministry and finds new creative initiatives to care for hurting and weak people. In IES we work with partners in communities to help them do the ministry they have committed their lives to as a way for resourcing them and strengthening their impact in the community over the long term. Orphanages, schools, garbage dump communities, and impoverished villages all allow our international churches to reach out for short and long-term ministry impact in this country.
