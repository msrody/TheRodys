# A Church Of All Ages

International churches are not limited to a certain demographic of age. Many ICs start by connecting with younger people, but they get married and raise their kids in the church. These parents desire for their kids to grow up with faith as a constant in their lives. For most, this is very different from how they grew up. There's a tremendous opportunity for growth and teaching with families.
Besides their desire for their kids to know God, members of ICs have parents who have yet come to faith in Christ. Some have a very traditional religious experience. Over time, ICs become a bridge for those beloved elders to see the impact of God on the lives of their children and grandchildren and in many cases their own lives. It is great to see God bringing whole families to faith. God is a long-term investor indeed and over the years we have seen many whole families come to faith in Christ.
