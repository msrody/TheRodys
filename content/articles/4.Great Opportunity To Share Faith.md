The variety of cultures and ethnicities in IES and other IC's give us a great opportunity to share faith. We're so obvioulsly different that it's okay to check us out. 

Spiritual development just seems to happen so much faster in an IC. Because people are somewhat disconnected from their regular social connections of their home culture, life in church become so much more impactful. People see their personal life transformation and feel very confident to share their stories and hope with others. Marketplace outreach is a real part of the life of an IC. Because church is in English it's often perceived as â€œfor foreigners". Some from other faith or experience see is as okay to attend as a cross-cultural or language learning experience. 

Because IC's don't look like preconceived notions of a local or formal church, an invitation to this new environment comes with less pressure. An IC becomes a safe place to bring those who are not yet in faith. This openness allows many to come for language learning or friendship connections and front slide right into the Kingdom of God as they grow in their understanding of what God has for them.
