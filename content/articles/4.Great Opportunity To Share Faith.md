# Great Opportunity To Share Faith

The variety of cultures and ethnicities in IES and other IC's give us a great opportunity to share faith, because we're so obvioulsly different.. A hallmark of ICs is the desire of our people to share their faith. So many people have seen their personal life transformation and feel very confident to share their stories and hope with others they live and work with. Marketplace outreach is a real part of the life of an IC. Because it’s in English some perceive that “it's for foreigners" or it’s okay to attend as a cross-cultural or language learning experience. Because IC's don't look like many people's preconceptions of a local church, an invitation to this new environment comes with less pressure and an IC becomes a safe place to bring those who are not yet in faith. This openness allows many to come for language learning or friendship connections and front slide right into the Kingdom of God as they grow in their understanding of what God has for them.
