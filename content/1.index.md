Missionaries with AGWM, serving in International Church Ministry in Asia Pacific.
::

We love building God's church by building up people. It's our desire to see His church grow wherever we are and see what He will do in the lives of those we minister with. For over 30 years we've been ministering together in multi-ethnic, multi-racial and multi-national contexts, with great opportunity to have significant, possitive impact over time.

International church ministry is our focus. In IES we preached, led worship and small groups, did pre-marital counseling and generally invested in people to grow God's kingdom everyday. We have a lot to give because God, who gives generously, has already given to us.

One of these great gifts is the church. We can't do ministry alone. We need partners whom God is calling to help and support the ministry he has given us to accomplish. Find out how you can partner us in ministry on our [Giving](https://therodys.com/giving) page. It's not just about financial giving. Check it out to see how you too can participate in ministry with us.

Want to know more about us and the ministry we're involved in? Check out our [Articles](https://therodys.com/articles), where you can read our thoughts, meet some of our friends, and see what kinds of things we do and value in life and ministry.

We know you might not remember to come back to our site, but we'd love to share with you what's happening as we go forward. If you'd like to hear from us, you can add yourself to our contacts list on our [Contacts](https://therodys.com/contacts) page by adding your info, so we can communicate with you directly. 

Thank you so much for partnering with us.
